        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p id="aboutme">With a robust foundation in both industry and education, I am a passionate programming instructor who brings over a decade of teaching experience and sixteen years of IT expertise as a database administrator to the classroom. My journey in technology began with a fascination for problem-solving, which naturally evolved into a rewarding career in database management. Over the years, I managed complex data systems, ensured data integrity, and optimized performance for enterprise-level applications.

After nearly two decades in IT, I transitioned to teaching, driven by a desire to inspire the next generation of programmers. For the past ten years, I have dedicated myself to making programming accessible and engaging for learners of all backgrounds. My teaching philosophy centers on demystifying coding concepts, fostering curiosity, and nurturing practical skills that empower students to build real-world solutions.

I leverage a variety of instructional strategies to reach diverse learners. Recognizing that not all students thrive in traditional lecture settings, I incorporate hands-on activities, collaborative projects, and real-life scenarios into my lessons. My experience as a database administrator allows me to provide students with industry-relevant insights, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

One of my signature approaches is the use of "unplugged" activities from code.org, which help students grasp abstract programming concepts without the immediate need for computers. These activities foster critical thinking and teamwork, laying a strong foundation before students transition to actual coding environments.

Throughout my teaching career, I have developed curricula for introductory and advanced programming courses, covering languages such as Python, Java, and SQL. I am adept at tailoring content to suit learners at various skill levels, from complete beginners to aspiring software engineers. My lessons emphasize computational thinking, algorithmic problem-solving, and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code.

I am deeply committed to continuous professional development. I regularly attend workshops, complete online courses, and participate in educator communities to stay abreast of the latest trends in computer science education. This commitment ensures that my teaching methods remain innovative and relevant in a rapidly evolving field.

My students describe me as approachable, patient, and enthusiastic. I strive to create an inclusive classroom environment where questions are encouraged, mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities, and every student feels valued. I take pride in mentoring students beyond the classroom, guiding them through coding competitions, hackathons, and independent projects.

Collaboration is at the heart of my teaching practice. I work closely with colleagues to integrate programming across the curriculum, demonstrating its relevance in subjects ranging from mathematics to the humanities. I also engage with parents and the broader community, organizing coding workshops and tech fairs to showcase student achievements and ignite interest in STEM fields.

My background as a database administrator informs my teaching in unique ways. I emphasize the importance of data literacy, security, and ethical considerations in software development. I encourage students to think critically about how technology shapes society and to approach programming with a sense of responsibility.

Over the years, I have witnessed the transformative power of programming education. I have seen students gain confidence, discover new passions, and pursue careers in technology. These successes fuel my dedication to teaching and reinforce my belief in the value of computer science education.

In summary, I am an experienced educator and IT professional committed to empowering learners through programming. My blend of industry knowledge, innovative teaching methods, and unwavering enthusiasm ensures that students not only learn to code but also develop the skills and mindset needed to thrive in the digital age.</p>
